1. all non zero rows are above any zero rows
2. each leading entry of a row is in a column that is to the right of a leading entry in an above row
	- leading entry: leftmost nonzero entry in a row
3. in a column, all entries below a leading entry are zeros

$$\begin{bmatrix} 
2 & 1 & 3 & 2\\
0 & 3 & 1 & 4\\
\end{bmatrix}
$$
# Reduced Echelon Form
4. the leading entry in each nonzero row is 1
5. each leading entry (1) is the only nonzero entry in its column
# Theorem 1
- a matrix can be reduced to many echelon forms, but only 1 reduced echelon form
