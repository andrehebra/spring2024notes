```HTML 
<image src="../randomImage.jpg" alt="random image">
```
- "alt" is an attribute of the "image" element that will display if the image cannot be loaded
# Quoting
- not always required $\rightarrow$ sometimes required
- best practice

> [!info] Example
> ```html
> <div class="container d-flex align-items-center justify-content-between"></div>
> ```
> the class has multiple values, so need a quote and space between each
