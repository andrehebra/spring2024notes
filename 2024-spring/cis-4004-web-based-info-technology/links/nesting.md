	<strong><em>strongly emphasized</em></strong>
	content</p>
```
- elements can be nested in other elements
```html
<ul>
	<li>first
	<li>second
	<li>third
</ul>
```

# Valid HTML Nesting
- html is forgiving, so sometimes elements that are written incorrectly will still be displayed
- [HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/)
	- this can be used to make sure that all elements are validly placed
